# Remote Applause

Add remote applause to your online conference. [Try it.](https://stuartlangridge.github.io/remote-applause)

You go to the page and add your conf name; it gives you a link; you give the link to attendees; they get a "clap" button to press; when they press it, your window plays the noise of clapping.

Entirely inspired by a tweet by Nicole Sullivan:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For online conferences, someone should make it so 👏🏻 or 😆 in the chat leads to the sound of claps and laughs on video. The audience feels like a missing piece of what makes conferences so special. (The more claps and laughs, the more clap and laugh track should be played)</p>&mdash; Nicole Sullivan (@stubbornella) <a href="https://twitter.com/stubbornella/status/1254164566017114112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2020</a></blockquote>
